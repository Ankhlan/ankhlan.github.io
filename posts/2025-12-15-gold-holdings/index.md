# Gold Holdings: Who Owns What

Central banks collectively hold about 36,000 tonnes of gold — roughly one-fifth of all gold ever mined. But ownership is highly concentrated, and the distribution has shifted meaningfully over the past two decades.

## The big holders

The top five holders account for over half of official gold:

| Country | Tonnes | % of Reserves |
|---------|-------:|:-------------:|
| United States | 8,133 | 69% |
| Germany | 3,353 | 66% |
| Italy | 2,452 | 64% |
| France | 2,437 | 59% |
| Russia | 2,333 | 26% |

The US, Germany, Italy, and France have held roughly stable positions for decades. The interesting action is elsewhere.

## The buyers

Since 2000, emerging market central banks have been net buyers:

Key patterns:

- **China** added ~1,900 tonnes (though actual holdings may be higher)
- **Russia** added ~1,900 tonnes, especially after 2014 sanctions
- **India, Turkey, Poland** have been consistent accumulators
- **Western European** central banks stopped selling after the financial crisis

## Why hold gold?

Central banks cite several motivations:

1. **Diversification** — uncorrelated with USD-denominated assets
2. **Sanction-proofing** — can't be frozen (if held domestically)
3. **Crisis reserve** — liquid in extremis
4. **Tradition** — path dependence from the gold standard era

## The revaluation question

Most central banks carry gold at historical cost (e.g., $42/oz for the US). Mark-to-market revaluation would dramatically change balance sheet optics — and potentially monetary policy flexibility.

This is worth a separate note.
