# Welcome

This is a working notebook published as a static site. It collects notes, analyses, and sketches on monetary economics, central banking, trading, and financial plumbing.

## Why a notebook?

Most writing online is either too polished (losing the texture of thinking) or too scattered (tweets, threads). A notebook sits in between: structured enough to be useful, rough enough to be honest.

## How it works

The site is built from:

- **Markdown files** — each article lives in its own folder with text, data, and scripts
- **Python scripts** — generate charts and tables from data
- **Static HTML** — no database, no server-side code, just files served by GitHub Pages

The layout is inspired by Edward Tufte's books: narrow text column, wide margins for notes and commentary.

## What you'll find

Topics I write about:

- **Reserves & Gold** — central bank balance sheets, gold flows, FX reserves
- **Yield Curves** — term structure, inversion signals, carry trades
- **Monetary Systems** — plumbing, settlements, correspondent banking
- **Market Structure** — liquidity, order flow, microstructure

Some entries are polished essays; most are working notes that may be updated as I learn more.

## Disclaimer

Nothing here is investment advice. Views are my own. Data and analysis may contain errors — always verify against primary sources.
