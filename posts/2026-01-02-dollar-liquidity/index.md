# Dollar Liquidity and the Offshore System

The dollar is unique: it's both a domestic currency and the dominant currency of global trade and finance. This creates a vast "offshore" dollar system that operates largely outside Fed supervision.

## The Eurodollar market

Dollars held in banks outside the US — "Eurodollars" — form a multi-trillion dollar market. These aren't physical bills; they're deposits and liabilities denominated in USD but booked abroad.

Key features:

- **No reserve requirements** (historically)
- **Outside Fed regulation** (mostly)
- **Critical for trade finance** and cross-border lending

## How offshore dollars are created

When a non-US bank makes a USD loan, it creates a USD deposit — just like domestic banking. The constraint isn't reserves but:

1. Access to USD funding (wholesale markets, swaps)
2. Correspondent banking relationships
3. Regulatory capital

## Why it matters

Offshore dollar scarcity shows up as:

- **FX basis blowouts** — cost of swapping EUR/JPY to USD spikes
- **Cross-currency basis** — premium for USD funding
- **Repo stress** — collateral shortages in USD

The Fed has responded to offshore stress with:

- **Swap lines** — lending USD to foreign central banks
- **FIMA repo** — letting foreign central banks repo Treasuries for USD

## The plumbing

Every offshore dollar ultimately traces back to a correspondent account at a US bank. This is the choke point — and why US sanctions are so powerful.
