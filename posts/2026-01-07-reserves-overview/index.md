## Understanding Central Bank Reserves

Central bank reserves are the assets held by a monetary authority to:

- **Back liabilities:** Currency in circulation and bank reserves
- **Intervene in markets:** Stabilize exchange rates and manage inflation
- **Provide confidence:** Signal creditworthiness to international markets
- **Enable development:** Fund critical infrastructure and social programs

## What Comprises Mongolia's Reserves?

Central bank reserves typically include:

- **Foreign Exchange (USD, EUR, CNY):** ~62% of reserves. Used for currency intervention and international transactions.
- **Gold:** ~22% of reserves. The ultimate store of value, held as insurance against systemic crisis.
- **SDRs & IMF Reserve Position:** ~12% of reserves. International purchasing power denominated by the IMF.
- **Other Assets:** ~4% of reserves. Bilateral swap lines, other claims, and holdings.

## Why This Matters for Mongolia

As a developing nation, Mongolia's reserve adequacy is critical. It determines:

- Our ability to weather external shocks (commodity price collapses, capital flight)
- Our sovereign debt ratings and borrowing costs
- Our currency stability and purchasing power
- Our independence from external pressures and IMF conditionality

## Data Sources & Methodology

- **IMF COFER:** Currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves (quarterly)
- **Bank of Mongolia:** Official monthly and weekly reserve publications
- **World Gold Council:** Central bank gold holdings and valuation
- **Official balance sheets:** Audited financial statements

## The Art of Transparency

This visualization is not merely data. It is a statement: *Your nation's wealth should be visible, intelligible, and subject to public debate.*

By rendering reserves as a living, breathing circle—updated in real-time—we emphasize that monetary policy is not abstract. It affects your purchasing power, your job security, your children's opportunities.

The circular design echoes Mongolian cosmology: eternal cycles, collective responsibility, balance between elements.

## Tracking Changes: Month-over-Month

- Monitor reserve flows to detect capital flight or interventions
- Decompose changes into valuation effects (gold price, FX movements) vs. net flows
- Compare reserve adequacy metrics (import cover, short-term debt cover, reserve-to-M2 ratio)

## Next Steps for Citizens

1. **Check monthly:** Subscribe to Bank of Mongolia reserve reports
2. **Compare regionally:** How do our reserves compare to Kazakhstan, Russia, China?
3. **Demand accountability:** Ask your representatives: How are reserves being deployed?
4. **Participate in policy:** Vote in our quarterly poll on reserve allocation priorities
5. **Share knowledge:** Educate peers about monetary sovereignty
