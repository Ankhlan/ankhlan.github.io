# Yield Curve Inversion: What It Tells Us

The yield curve — the relationship between interest rates and maturities — is one of the most watched indicators in macro. When short-term rates exceed long-term rates (inversion), recessions often follow.

## The current picture

The 2-year vs 10-year spread has been a reliable recession predictor:

- **Inverted 1978** → recession 1980
- **Inverted 1989** → recession 1990
- **Inverted 2000** → recession 2001
- **Inverted 2006** → recession 2008
- **Inverted 2022** → ???

## Why does it work?

Several theories:

1. **Expectations hypothesis** — markets expect the Fed to cut rates due to coming weakness
2. **Risk premium** — term premium compression signals flight to safety
3. **Bank lending** — flat/inverted curve reduces bank profitability, tightening credit
4. **Self-fulfilling** — enough people believe it that it affects behavior

Probably all four contribute.

## What to watch

The inversion itself isn't the signal — it's the **re-steepening** that typically precedes the recession. The curve often normalizes as the Fed begins cutting, which is when the recession arrives.

Current readings:

| Spread | Level | Signal |
|--------|------:|--------|
| 2y-10y | +15bp | Normalizing |
| 3m-10y | -20bp | Still inverted |
| Fed funds - 2y | -50bp | Cuts expected |

## The lag

Historical lag from inversion to recession: 6–24 months. This time? Unknown.
